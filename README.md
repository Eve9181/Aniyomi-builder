# Aniyomi-builder
quick preview build for testing


# how to make apk:

-- just go to `actions` and run either `stable` or `preview` build -- wait aproxx 10 minutes BOOM!!! apks

## features:
- change app name
- change application id

> basically it allows you to create separate apps.

> example - current aniyomi application id is `xyz.jmir.tachiyomi.mi` (`.debug` is added by default in case of preview or debug build)

> so if you make it from `xyz.jmir.tachiyomi.mi` to `xyz.fakebhai.tachiyomi.mi` it'll become a diffrent app

## to-do
- fix logo change option for all builds (broken)
